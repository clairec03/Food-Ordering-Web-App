In 12th grade of high school, my local high school decided to place restrictions on in-person food orders during COVID-19. In response to limited food options on campus, I collaborated with my Programming II cohort to develop a cross-platform web application that accepts and processes online food orders, allowing students to return to enjoying snacks on campus.
